This app/template is for a new blogger who feels overwhelmed by the steps involved in building their own blog, and needs to build their website but is not sure where to start.

It was created using the React Redux Complete tutorial playlist on The Net Ninja YouTube channel, but altered in a few key ways to make it more of a blank slate for the user to start out with.

The target end user is someone who wants to get started blogging on their own platform, building their own website, but doesn't know where to begin and could benefit from a customizable but easy to use template.

Link to publicly deployed app/template will soon follow.
